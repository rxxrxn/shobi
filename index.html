     <!--introduction-->
     <div class="intro"><p>I am happy, at this moment right now, you are in front of me, reading the thing you wanted to listen to since the beginning, I can already tell while I am writing this that, I will never in my life regret anything that will happen today because ofc how can someone regret the best decision of their life.
        I don’t know where to start but I am going with the flow, offffff…..!!!! <br>
        Hi Ranjan,
        Mudal here, and now she will tell you a lot here on these webpages she created just for you, like a lot is there for you to read and process and feel just in these few minutes I will take from you, maybe it was a stupid idea of me to create web pages for this but here goes nothing, I already made them, you are already reading them, I am already in front of you watching your reaction of every word you will read or everything you will see. <br>
        My Moon, hope you must be doing fine right now, and day your day must be filled with all the happiness you ever wished for. <br>
        Okay please don’t be nervous(idk why I am telling you not to be nervous in fact I am really nervous), I am here in front of you. <br>
        When I was writing this for you, I did not had enough words maybe that's why i couldn't write much, it is a small thing in front of all the things that you have done for me but I was just really excited to make you some web pages, I know it’s not the most beautiful or prettiest, I am still learning, everything you see here is written in codes and no outer source was added to make it look something extravagant, this is all that I have learnt. <br>
        It’s part of your birthday gift and something else will be waiting for you when you will be front of me physically and not on the screen, hope you will like it, hope you will love it, I really don’t know.</p><br>

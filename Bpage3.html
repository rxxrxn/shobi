    <p id="feelings"> Now I cannot wait any longer to call you “my love”, I was tempted to do so for a long time, like every day every minute, every second of the day, so here comes the day I will finally call you ‘love’. <br>
        Love, <br>
        You always wanted to know my feelings right? Let me write it all here for you, so finally here it goes:
        I don’t know a lot of things and I am not sure about a lot that happens but one thing all these days and right now at this moment I am sure about is YOU. I wanted to be crystal clear about my feelings(even though I was sure about them for kind of like few weeks or maybe for many days, bas thoda sa surprise dena tha) because I didn’t know if I would be able to handle everything all at once,
        but you told me that love is not a thing to handle but to feel and live through it. I was fighting this urge of mine every day to tell you how much I love you, my love, I was fighting the urge so hard to answer your proposals, every time you said or asked if I wanted to be with you, I wanted to scream my heart and lungs out that yes, I want to hear you call me yours for so long, I want to call yourself mine for so long, I wanted to reply to your every note saying how much I am deeply getting in love with you, I was fighting everything, ykw it’s really hard to keep your feelings hidden from a person even though not for everyone but trust me it was really hard for me.
        I want a future where I don’t want to ask about your days but to live them with you, waking up next to you, sleeping with you, eating with you, laughing with you, showering with you, crying with you, working with you, doing the chores with you, watch anime with you and what not.
        I will buy flowers for you, your favourite cheesecake, your one and only perfume, and will go shopping with you to get us matching fits and T-shirts, I wanted to do a lot with you, just with you, and just for you.
        The first time I realised I was in love with you was when I looked at you under the moon, my brain couldn’t process it at that time but my heart did because I never in my life admired something so much, I realised like damnnn Ridhi you actually love this person since the beginning. You don’t know how many tears I have held back reading your letters, you don’t know how many times I have to cover my love for you with my laugh, you don’t know times I wanted to call you mine but couldn’t, you don’t know how much I was waiting for this moment because never in my life I have been so patient about something, you don’t know the temptation I had to fight every time you used to say you love me and I couldn’t say it back to you(ofc because I wanted to make this day(19th Oct) the best for you, so you would love your birthday), I was maybe trying to hide a lot but maybe you knew all along.
        I always wanted my boyfriend to treat me like the 8th wonder of the world, and here you are treating me like I am the first and the last wonder of this world.
         <br>
         Read this somewhere and now I say this to the moon every other day,” Mat puch mujhse mere jaagne ki wajah ae chaand, koi tera hi hamshakal hai jo soone nhi deta”.

        Will you be mine love? Will you be my boyfriend? Will you allow me to take care of you? Always and forever? Will you be my man? Will you make me the luckiest girl in the world? Will you accept me? Will you accept the child inside me? Are you willing to make me yours? Are you willing to have the tag of Ridhi’s boyfriend? Are you willing to get all my hugs and kisses? Will you now officially be the winner of my heart? Can I say ILOVEYOU(without space so there will be no space for anyone else) to you forever? Are you willing to be the person I share all my laughs, sorrows and excitement with? Are you willing to be the one who will never get tired or annoyed with me?

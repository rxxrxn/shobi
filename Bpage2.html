    <p>Happy birthday to MY Shobi baby, god has always blessed you because just look at you you are god’s definition of ‘perfection’ may he bless you more, god sure took a lot of extra time to create his creation or maybe a bunch of gods worked together to work on their best creation and created you.
      I will always pray that you get everything in your life, everything you have missed, everything taken from you, everything you wished for, everything you lacked, and so much more.
      I am so happy that your parents did not sleep that day and decided to do ‘the thing’(👉🏻👈🏻), 19th Oct is blessed because you were born today, the person who makes this world a little more living-worthy and beautiful.
      On this special day, I want to remind you of just how amazing and important you are in my life. Your smile brightens my darkest days, and your love warms my heart in the most incredible ways. I want to celebrate not just the day you were born, but also the day you came into my life. You bring so much joy, love, and happiness into my world, and I'm grateful for every moment we’ve shared and everything you’ve done for me.
      Reminding you that now you are not just a year older but also a year wiser, more handsome, more amazing, and more adorable. Your smile lights up my world, and your presence fills my life with happiness. I'm so grateful to have you by my side, and I can't wait to create more incredible memories together.
      You always tell me how proud you are of me, but Ranjan trust me I am proudx1000 of you, every day you are waking up and trying, getting things done and carrying a big-big smile on your face, the loving and feel like home look on your face, OH LORD!!!!
      You’re God’s best creation Shobi, I’ve understood that now it’s your turn to realise that. At times when I did not feel like myself, you gives me hope, a reason to be ME again, every time, every day, every past minute, you’re in my mind running from here to there fixing everything.
      It sometimes feels like god sent you to me because maybe he heard all my prayers, imagine if I hadn’t come to Gulab ji that morning, or did not asked you, again and again, to hang out, or in the beginning what if out of ego I didn’t have accepted your request in the first place, what if I would’ve given up just after hanging out with you once? What if then? Glad I did not, glad I messaged, glad we talked, and glad we hung out.
      Now I can see those impulsive decisions turning out to be one of the best decisions of my life, I mean I got YOU what else I need.
      It’s your birthday but here I am getting a gift(YOU), you’re always there when I need you, motivating me, telling me all the good things, and always making me realise that it was a bad day and everything will be okay.
      Happy birthday, baby, I’ll always be there with you no matter what, and I’ll always try to help us grow, I promise to be there when you want someone you could lay and just rant with, I’ll be your best friend when you’ll want one, I’ll be the lover you could share all your laughs and sorrows with, I’ll be the listener to hear it all, I’ll be the clown who will always make you laugh, I’ll be the light in the darkroom for you, and I’ll be the dark comfort when lights will shine too bright, I’ll be whatever it takes to make you happy. I can and I will fight the whole world if they try to hurt you in any way, I can and I will make people regret their life choices if they try to poke their nose in your life, I promise I will try my best to make you happy and fill your life with all the love you deserve. I am so sorry this world always has been so mean to you, but I’ll make them all think about their decisions again.
      They say “If you kiss a wound it’ll heal, but I can’t kiss your heart. so I’ll kiss your lips, your neck, your skin, your back, and every other part. And I hope one day, they’ll sink in, and something inside you starts because where you see yourself as less worthy, all I see is a work of art. so I’ll begin painting the canvas with the stain on my lips. And I’ll always be there to remind you in case you forget. That life is far from meaningless you hold the universe within. Know that you can do anything with your fathom if you only would believe. And there is so much love around you more than you conceive. But I hope you find it in yourself before you find it in anyone else”.
      You know what? It’s like, my “Miss Independent we don’t need no man” era is most sweetly interrupted by a 10/10 man with only green flags. And I won, the day I saw you for the first time, without even realising I won when I got you. I’ll always pray if I give birth to a boy in future, I’ll(actually we will) always raise him to be like you. You’re a gift, to me and to everyone who has you in their life. I got the greatest and best gift when you were born 20 years back, it’s just I received it recently, I waited long enough to get you, and now I won’t let you go away no matter what.
      “Ab to mere Bhagwan bhi mujhe tujhse durr nhi krenge”.
